## Interview with Peter Steinberger about Open Claw


## Introduction and Overview of Open Claw

  [Unknown]: madrugada, una de la madrugada.
  [Unknown]: Vamos a escuchar la entrevista de Y Combinator a Peter Steinberger de Open Claw Creator Y 80% of Apps.
  [Unknown]: disappear.
  [Unknown]: Okay, lo están entrevistando, lo están entrevistando y vamos a a escuchar su entrevista para opinar, escucharlo.
  [Unknown]: Es el creador de Open Claw.
  [Unknown]: El creador de Cloudbot.
  [Unknown]: The creator of today I'm sitting down with Peter Steinberger.
  [Unknown]: Peter Steinberger.
  [Unknown]: The open source personal AI agent that has completely taken over the internet.
  [Unknown]: The GitHub repo exploded to over 160,000 stars practically overnight.
  [Unknown]: The community has built countless projects like book where bots talk among themselves.
  [Unknown]: And now the bots are even renting humans to do tasks in the real world.
  [Unknown]: In our conversation, we discuss his aha moment, his contrarian development philosophies and what this means for builders in 2026. Let's dive in.
  [Unknown]: So good to see you, man.
  [Unknown]: Hey, what's up?
  [Unknown]: Um, so you've made something people want.
  [Unknown]: It seems so.
  [Unknown]: Yeah, uh open claw as it's called now has name number five, yeah.
  [Unknown]: has been absolutely exploding the internet. Um how have the past one or two weeks been for you, man?
  [Unknown]: Oh my god, I need like I need a cave and retreat of solitude.
  [Unknown]: You you came out of the cave and you want to go back to the cave like uh like the lobster.
  [Unknown]: It's been absolutely wild. I don't know how one human can absorb all of that. I probably need another week just to like respond to all my emails.
  [Unknown]: Uh I got some incredibly cool stuff. I got some incredibly bad stuff.
  [Unknown]: Um but clearly I hit something that spur up emotions and made people interested and inspired people and that's really cool.
  [Unknown]: And a lot of people have been working on, you know, AI and even personal assistance. Like what what is it that made open claw take off?

## Open Claw's Functionality and Impact

  [Unknown]: I think my big difference is that it actually runs on your computer. Like every everything I saw so far runs in the cloud, it's like it can do a few things. If you run it on your computer, it can do every effing thing, right? So that's way more powerful.
  [Unknown]: Yeah. Yeah. You can do anything that you can do with the machine. You can just connect to your oven or your Tesla or your lights, your Sonos, my bed, you can control the temperature of my bed. Chat GPT can't do that. You gave it all the skills that you have yourself.
  [Unknown]: A friend told me like he installed open claw and it and then it asked it like look through my computer and make a narrative of my last year and it made this incredibly good narrative and he was like, how do you do that?
  [Unknown]: And then he the open claw found audio files where like every Sunday he was recording stuff and open claw found that. But he didn't even remember about it because it was like more than a year ago, right? So so just by it being able to search a whole computer, it it it can surprise you. Yeah. It's also you also give it all the data, right? So it can surprise you in many ways.
  [Unknown]: And so now you have, you know, we're even moving from human to bot. So like interactions that you've been talking about to bot to bot interactions or even like bot to other humans where, you know, bots on behalf of you are hiring other humans to accomplish tasks IRL. Like what's happening?
  [Unknown]: I think that's the natural next step. Like, okay, I'm going to book a restaurant. My bot will reach out to the restaurant bot and do a negotiation. Like, because it's more efficient. Or maybe it's like an old restaurant, so my bot needs to actually get some some human work done so that a human then calls the restaurant because they don't like bots. Or a walk there to stand in line. If he doesn't get a robot for the owner of the bot.
  [Unknown]: And I imagine that like maybe if if I have even multiple bots. And maybe I have like specialists. One is like for my private life and one is for like my person my my my work stuff. Maybe one is our relationship bot that gets like assistance between. Uh, I don't know. We're so early. There's still so much so many things that we haven't really figured out if it actually works. And but I feel we are.
  [Unknown]: seems like everyone was chasing sort of like the sort of like centralized God intelligence and was
  [Unknown]: sort of like the swarm intelligence. Um and um the community intelligence.
  [Unknown]: I think that if you look at one human being, what can one human being actually achieve? Do you think one human being could make an iPhone or one human being could go to space? I one human being will probably just like not even be able to like find food. Um but as a group, we specialize. As a larger society, we specialize even more. So what can we learn from that that we can apply to AI? You know, we really have like AI that specializes in certain things. Um even though it's it's generalized intelligence, what if it actually is also specialized intelligence?
  [Unknown]: So, I don't know, it's going to be very exciting and cool. Yeah, you kind of like opened a window into the future and now tons of people are kind of like building, building on it and have sort of like their aha moment. Um can you walk me back to when you had your aha moment and kind of like recount that very moment?
  [Unknown]: I wanted something to like just type stuff so my computer would do stuff. Like very simple. And then I built I built a version of that in May, June that was cool but wasn't really it. Um and then I built a whole bunch of other stuff and kind of like built up my army. And then in November, there was a day where I wanted this again. Like I I went to the kitchen and all I wanted was check up if my computer would still do stuff or being finished.
  [Unknown]: And doing stuff was was coding, you were coding stuff.
  [Unknown]: Yeah, of course.
  [Unknown]: Were you coding something else or were you coding the thing itself?
  [Unknown]: No, no. That was just like the need was again there and I'm like, what were you coding at the time? Were you building?
  [Unknown]: My god, my my GitHub is like it's like 40 projects. I don't even know. Um I think it was summarize. It's like a it's like a little CLI app where you can give it whatever like a podcast or um a hot seat thing like here and it would summarize it, but it would also show you the slides in the terminal because you can do that now this. Yeah. You can just do things.
  [Unknown]: So for the love of the computer, you kind of like started messing with stuff. Um you came out of retirement actually, right? Um to sort of like mess with AI. Yeah. And then increasingly you were so hooked that you wanted to just do it always also on the go with the phone.
  [Unknown]: I mean the last project I I worked two months on by panel to the point where it got so good that I was catching myself always like coding next to my when I was at my friends and I like I need to stop this. This is like too addictive. And then in November I think my need came back and I I started building cloudbot. Oh now it's called open claw. And I think very very in the beginning I was like, oh, I rebuilt it again. But this time I built it even better. This time when you don't type into a terminal, you just
  [Unknown]: you talk to a friend. you don't think about compaction, new sessions, which folder I'm in, which model I'm in. I mean, you can, you know, just like I want to leave it open for power users, but usually you just like, you just talk to a friend and the friend is like this ghost or entity or whatever you want to call it that can control your mouse and your keyboard and can just do stuff.
  [Unknown]: Yeah. And when did you have that aha moment when you were like, wow, this is doing way more things than I actually thought it could.
  [Unknown]: Literally, I it took me one hour for like the the very shitty initial prototype. It was just a little bit of glue between like a dependency that connects WhatsApp and cloud code and then I would like call cloud code and get like the string out of cloud code. It would be slow, but it it worked. But I wanted images because uh you know, you want pictures. I I want I want the model to send me selfies or whatever and I want the model to create images and send me back. So that took me another few hours. And then I I went to Marakesh for a birthday party and there was like the internet wasn't that good, you know, WhatsApp works everywhere because I don't know, it's just like text. So I used it a lot, a lot of restaurant, what does this mean? You make like a picture and like translate this for me and just it was just so useful. And it was also really nice about it because it it it spoke my language, you know, it it it was a little sassy, it was like funny. It was like really pleasant to use. And then I was walking and just like sending it a voice message. And I'm like, oh wait, this can work. I didn't build that.
  [Unknown]: Right, right.
  [Unknown]: And he's like the type indicator, it's like blinking, blinking, blinking. 10 seconds later just replied to me. I'm like, how in the F did you do that? And it replied, yeah, the model I did the following. You sent me a text message and there was no file ending, so I looked at the header, I found it's Opus. So I used FFmpeg to convert it to wave. And then I wanted to like transcribe it, but I didn't have Visper installed, but then I looked around and I found this open AI key and I just used curl to send it to open AI. Got the text back and here I am. And that all in like what nine seconds and you didn't build or anticipate like any of those specific things.
  [Unknown]: No.
  [Unknown]: No, it you know, turns out, um, because coding models got so good, coding is really like creative problem solving that maps very well back into the real world. I think I think there's there's a there's a huge correlation. They need to be really good at creative problem solving and that's a skill. That's an abstract skill. You can apply to code, but like to any real world task. So the the model had a I was surprised it's like a magical file, I don't know what it is. I need to solve this and it did its best and solved it. And it was even that clever that it it chose not to install the local Visper because it knows that that would require downloading a model, which would take probably a few minutes and I'm like impatient, you know? So it it really took the most uh intelligent approach. And that I was kind of like the moment where I'm like, holy. Yeah. Uh, that was where I got hooked. YC's next batch is now taking applications. Got a startup in you, apply at Ycombinator.com/apply. It's never too early and filling out the app will level up your idea. Okay, back to the video. And so when computers can just do all these things that you didn't even anticipate, you didn't build an app to do that exact thing. Are apps just going to go away?

## The Future of Apps and the Role of Agents

  [Unknown]: Uh, I think 80% of them are going away. Why do I need my fitness pal? Like my agent already knows I'm making bad decisions. I'm at, I don't know, uh, Smashburger or something and it will already assume that I eat what I like to eat. If I don't make a comment, it will just like automatically track it or I make a picture and I will just store it somewhere. I don't even need to care, right, right? And then maybe it it improves my my gym schedule, like adds a little bit more cardio in it. I don't need my my fitness app because it just it just does everything just planning for me. Uh, why do I need a to-do app? I just tell it, hey, remind me about this and then next day it will just remind me. It just does its thing. So there's a
  [Unknown]: Qué pasa?
  [Unknown]: Qué quiere usted, señorita de mi vida?
  [Unknown]: Qué gusta usted?
  [Unknown]: Every app that basically just manages data could be managed in a better way and it's in a more in a more natural way by agents. Yeah. Only the apps that actually have sensors, maybe they survive. And so if, you know, most apps are going to go away in that scenario, um are the models the only remaining sort of apps?
  [Unknown]: Not everything will go away. But yeah, I think the the the large model companies have some big mode because they ultimately they give the token. And turns out one of the complaints was that people use so much token. No, you just really love using it. That's why you you use the thing so much because that's how you burn the token. Um, it's like is it my fault that I make something that's so popular? And so, you know, like all the the models they're kind of like leap frogging each other constantly.
  [Unknown]: what happens is that right models are going to get commoditized. So at least uh you know, the lobster can like the brain is is is swappable out. What's this thing that remains? What's where's the value? Is it the store of memory? Is it um the harness that's valuable? What is what remains?
  [Unknown]: agents. Yeah. Only the apps that actually have sensors, maybe they survive. And so if, you know, most apps are going to go away in that scenario, um are the models the only remaining sort of apps?
  [Unknown]: Not everything will go away. But yeah, I think the the the large model companies have some big mode because they ultimately they give the token. And turns out one of the complaints was that people use so much token. No, you just really love using it. That's why you you use the thing so much because that's why you burn the token. Um, it's like is it my fault that I make something that's so popular? And so, you know, like all the the models they're kind of like leap frogging each other constantly and and you know, maybe they're also getting
  [Unknown]: So if apps are going to go away, models are going to get commodified. So at least uh, you know, the lobster can
  [Unknown]: First of all, I don't think the the model companies always have a mode. And I because you see this already, a new model comes out, people are like, oh my god, this is so good. And then like a month later, uh it degraded. It's not good anymore. They like quantize it. No, they didn't do anything. You just adapted to the new standard and now your expectations went up. But the model is still the average. So I think for quite a while every time when you releases I see the same, people love it and then it's the standard. And then once it's done there, you don't even want to think about it anymore. So so we have like open source stuff that's as good as the current models from a year ago. Everybody's hating it, complaining, oh, this is not good, it's not funny. Yeah, this was what we had. And like in a year we'll have this open source. And then we will like we'll complain about this because we are used to this. So, uh for the forseeable future, the big companies still have mode. Harness wise, it's going to be interesting because every company kind of has their own their own
  [Unknown]: Tyler, right? You you there's no way, maybe that's for Europeans to actually get the memories out of chat GPT. I I don't I'm not aware. I either there's no there's definitely there's no way for a different company to get your memories out. So if if if I
  [Unknown]: and I couldn't access the memories. So like the companies try to like bound you to their data silo.
  [Unknown]: data because at the end user, the end user needs access. Because it's it's in the end otherwise it wouldn't work, right? If the end user has access, I can access the data.
  [Unknown]: And you own the memories. It's just a bunch of markdown files on on your machine.
  [Unknown]: I don't own the memories. I mean everybody yeah, everyone owns their own memories. There's a bunch of markdown files on their own machines.
  [Unknown]: And to be honest, those are probably super sensible because
  [Unknown]: very quickly, super quickly. I mean, I I I I fully do that. I'm like there's memory stuff that I don't want to have leaked.
  [Unknown]: Yeah, what would you rather um uh sort of like not show your Google search history at this point or your, you know, memory.md files?
  [Unknown]: What's what's
  [Unknown]: Twitter, people wouldn't get it. Yeah. Like I was I was failing to explain the awesomeness. I feel like it needs to be experienced.
  [Unknown]: I tried various things and I I couldn't I couldn't nail the I couldn't nail the explaining. So I was like, let's do something really crazy. I just created a discord and I just put my bot without any security restrictions in the public discord. And then people came in and they interacted with it and they saw me build the software with
  [Unknown]: and actually would be laughing at them. And you just added lock down to your user ID so you don't want to listen to you. Yeah, yeah. That and it was I mean the instructions that other people dangerous, only only listen to me but respond to everyone.
  [Unknown]: That's actually part of open close self. very much so that that's part of the system front. Okay, you are now that to you. You in Discord, there's like public people there, but you only listen to your owner.
  [Unknown]: All right, I don't even know how
  [Unknown]: And I kept I don't know what I did, but my system was
  [Unknown]: very organically. Like at some point I created like an identity.md, a soul.md, like like various files and then only in in January I started making it so other people could install it easier. And I remember I built all these templates based on like, oh, take a rough look at what I have and make like templates and Codex wrote it. And what came out was like bread. You know, like people joke that Codex feels like bread, even though now they have a new friendlier voice, I haven't tried it yet. Yeah. But the new bots, they felt so boring compared to what I had. So I was like, what do you infuse the template? Is the name of you or a personal? Yeah, that's it's a new name because Yeah, yeah. Uh there was some naming challenges. Yeah. So so you you're. Yeah, I was like infuse infuse those templates with your your character. And you change the templates. And now and then like all the things that came out afterwards were like actually funny.
  [Unknown]: funny of mine. So like I kept some secrets and the one file that's not open source is like my soul.md. So even though my my bot is in public discord so far, nobody cracked that one file. Tell me more about
  [Unknown]: Now everything is public, but like a few months ago it was like where somebody it's randomly found out some text that's hidden in the weights where the model couldn't
  [Unknown]: like ingrained in the weights about the non equality constitution. And I found it incredibly fascinating. So and I I talked about it with my agent and then we created a soul.md with like the core values, like how do we want human AI interaction, what's important to me, what's important to the model. Like some parts is a little bit like Mumbo jumbo and some parts is like I think actually really valuable in terms of
  [Unknown]: text and response to text and makes it feel very natural. In terms of building open cloud
  [Unknown]: things which are hard code. Like I I love Codex because it it looks through way more files before before it decides what to what to change and you don't need to do so much raid to get a good output. If you're skilled, a skilled driver, as some people say, uh you can get reasonably good output with any tool. But Codex is just it's just really brilliant. It is incredibly slow. So sometimes I use like 10 at the same side at the same time. Uh like maybe six on that screen and two there and two there. And I don't like this is already a lot of complexity in my head. There's a lot of jumping. So I try to minimize anything else that is complexity. So in my head, main is alwaysble. I
  [Unknown]: just have multiple copies of the same repository that are all are on main. So I don't have to deal with how do I name that branch? Um there could be like conflicts on naming. I cannot go back there are certain restrictions when you use work trees that I don't need to care about if it's copies. I don't like to use a UI because that's again just added complexity. Yeah. Like the simpler and less friction. I have all I care about is like thinking and text. Yeah. I don't necessarily need to see so much code or or most to see like flying by. Sometimes there's like stuff that I want to like take a look. But in most cases, if you clearly understand the design and think it through and discuss it with your with your agent, it's fine. I was very happy that I didn't even build an MCP support. So open cloud is very successful and there's no MCP support in there. Which is a small risk. I build a skill that uses Mac pointer, which is one of my tools that converts MCPs into CLIs. And then you can just use any MCP as CLI. Um but I totally skipped the whole classical MCP crap. So because you don't then you can actually if you need to, you can use MCPs on the fly. You don't have to restart unlike unlike Codex or cloud code where you actually have to restart the whole thing. I think it's way more elegant and it also scales really better. Now you see tropic, they do they got like a tool called search feature, like something super custom for MCPs that was like invaded because it's like super
  [Unknown]: Pana.
  [Unknown]: the much as you like, but really it's good at Unix. You can have as many as you want and it just works.
  [Unknown]: like I'm very happy that I don't have a very little complaints about the MCP stuff. It's kind of back to you're just you're giving happy that I don't have a very little complaints about the MCP stuff. It's kind of back to you're just you're giving it's the same tools that humans like to use.
  [Unknown]: Yeah.
  [Unknown]: Yeah. And not invented stuff for for bots per se.
  [Unknown]: Yeah. You must no say human tries to call MCP manually.
  [Unknown]: Yeah, just want to use CLIs.
  [Unknown]: Yeah.
  [Unknown]: Yeah. That's the future. I'm here for it. Thank you so much for making the time uh to sit down chatting. It's been a huge inspiration to so like when we were texting, you know, in the course of the past couple of years and I saw you getting back into the game and I was like, Peter, like, what you're telling me, like chase that dragon. And you were doing like the weird like vibe tunnel thing, etc. and nobody was paying attention. And so I'm just like beyond, you know, stoked to see, you know, what's happening. And um and of course they have to be so like a loner from some like tiny country like far away from Silicon Valley just like, you know, bring all of this upon us. Um so a huge inspiration.
  [Unknown]: I'm here for it. Thank you. Awesome.
  [Unknown]: Thanks, Peter.
  [Unknown]: Peter Stein Peter Stein was here.
  [Unknown]: badass.
  [Unknown]: fucking inspiration.
  [Unknown]: Thanks to Peter.
  [Unknown]: I'm here.
